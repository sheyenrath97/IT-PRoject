    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>Lucky cats have been a part of my life since early adulthood. I found them through anime, and over time, they became more than symbols—they became friends. Their presence brings me peace, luck, and comfort.</p>

    <h2>My First Lucky Cat</h2>
    <p>My first lucky cat was a black cookie jar from World Market. It wasn't just a decoration—it felt like a part of me. When my ex-husband broke it, it felt like a piece of my heart cracked too. Even now, I remember how it made me feel: safe, understood, and never alone.</p>

    <h2>Why I Love Them</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Cats were there when people weren’t.</li>
      <li>They bring a sense of luck and emotional comfort.</li>
      <li>They connect me to anime and Japanese culture.</li>
    </ul>

      “Even when no one else was there, a little lucky cat smiled at me from the shelf. That was enough.”
